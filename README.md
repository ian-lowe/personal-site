# Project 0 - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I took this opportunity to build a mockup of a portfolio website. My goal was to practice responsive design and become more comfortable with CSS formatting. Some content is Lorem ipsum, but I went about it trying to make something that I might actually use.

My project includes 4 html files and 1 stylesheet file (not including Bootstrap).

**index.html** - The main page of my website. This includes a picture and brief introduction.

**resume.html** - A digital resume page of sorts. Includes an option to print on larger screens. This page is most responsive of the four.

**portfolio.html** - An extension of the resume page, meant to showcase my current and future projects. Mostly lorem ipsum :)

**blog.html** - A mock blog page.

**styles.css** - My main stylesheet for the project.
